class Person {
    protected String name;

    void showInfo() {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        this.name = "name"; // default name for demo
    }

    @Override
    void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("I am " + name + ", a student.");
    }

    void sendMessage() {
        System.out.println("Message sent to teacher.");
    }

    void sendMessage(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Message sent to teacher: " + msg);
    }
}

Instructions:
Create a base class called Person
Add a protected String name variable
Add a void showInfo() method that prints the name.

Scenario:
You are creating a simple program for a SmartSchool System.
 There are Students and Teachers, and each can send messages in their own way.
 Inside the school, some information is protected and can only be seen by people inside the school (not outsiders).





Create subclasses:
Student (inherits Person)
Teacher (inherits Person)

Inside both subclasses:
Override the showInfo() method:
Student prints → “I am [name], a student.”
Teacher prints → “I am [name], a teacher.”
Add a new method named sendMessage() that prints something different for each one.

Use Method Overloading
In the Student class, create two versions of sendMessage():
One with no parameter → prints “Message sent to teacher.”
One with a String msg parameter → prints “Message sent to teacher: [msg]”


In your Main class, do this:

Person p1 = new Student();
Person p2 = new Teacher();

p1.showInfo();
p2.showInfo();

Student s1 = new Student();
s1.sendMessage();
s1.sendMessage("Can I submit my project tomorrow?");


🧩 Expected Output:
I am name, a student.
I am Jazz, a teacher.
Message sent to teacher.
Message sent to teacher: Can I submit my project tomorrow?






class Teacher extends Person {
    Teacher() {
        this.name = "Jazz"; // teacher's name
    }

    @Override
    void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("I am " + name + ", a teacher.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Student();
        Person p2 = new Teacher();

        p1.showInfo();
        p2.showInfo();

        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.sendMessage();
        s1.sendMessage("Can I submit my project tomorrow?");
    }
}
